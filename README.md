# Django Learning Project

This project is a step-by-step  
The goal is to build a blog-like application (similar to social networks) while practicing core Django concepts such as models, views, templates, admin, and database operations.

## Features (so far)
- Create and manage posts with title, content, and publish date
- Admin panel integration
- Filter posts by publish date (only show published posts)

- Frontend improvements
